# Chat-Processor
Chat Processor is a Sourcemod-based plugin system designed to allow other plugins to manipulate text directly in the engine. This is essentially a giant upgrade and optimization project for the old Simple Chat Processors plugin which now has bugs and other weird design decisions.

# To-Do
* Add 'SayText' support to the plugin.
